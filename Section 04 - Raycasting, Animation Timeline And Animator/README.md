# Raycasting, Animation Timeline & Animator

In this section, I explored advanced techniques in Unity involving raycasting, navigation mesh (NavMesh) baking, and sophisticated animation systems. I learned to seamlessly integrate camera movements, animate 3D models, and manipulate game object interactions to create a more interactive and immersive game environment.
