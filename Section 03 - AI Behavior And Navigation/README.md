# AI Behavior & Navigation

In this class, I delved into crafting intelligent and reactive AI systems using Unity for a stealth-based game. I also learned how to implement sophisticated navigation systems and design AI behaviors that challenge players while keeping the gameplay engaging and dynamic.

## Key Topics Covered:

- **Canvas UI Health**: Implementing a health display using Unity's UI system to give real-time feedback to players.

- **Enemy States & Enums**: Defining various enemy states (like patrolling, chasing, alert) using enumerations to manage AI behaviors effectively.

- **NavMesh Baking**: Techniques for setting up and optimizing NavMesh in Unity to enable complex AI pathfinding.

- **NavMesh Agent**: Configuring NavMesh agents to navigate the game world intelligently, avoiding obstacles and seeking the player.

- **Setting up AI Patrolling Behavior**: Creating a patrolling route for enemies using waypoints and making the patrol behavior customizable.

- **AI Range & Radius Checking**: Implementing range and radius checks for AI to detect the player and engage or disengage based on specific conditions.

- **Damage to Player**: Scripting interactions where the AI can harm the player, decreasing health based on various factors like attack type or AI level.

- **Damage to Enemies**: Allowing the player to damage AI characters, incorporating health reductions and feedback mechanisms like animations or sounds.
